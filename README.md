## Tips & Notes

* **Best results** with photos directly from your camera (EXIF data intact)
* **Social media photos** often have EXIF stripped - use originals
* **RAW support** works for metadata extraction (no image preview)
* **GPS mapping** only works if your camera records location data
* **Large collections** (1000+ photos) may take a few minutes to analyze
